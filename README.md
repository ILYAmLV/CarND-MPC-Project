## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to implement **` Model Predictive Control`** in `C++` to drive the car around a track in a driving simulation. Unlike the last project **` PID Control`** simulator provided the **`Cross Track Error`** `(CTE)` and the **`Velocity`** `(mph)`. Our job was completing the PID class in `PID.cpp` and initializing the PID variable in `main.cpp`.
